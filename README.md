Visual Testing in Katalon Studio
======

# What is this repository?

This is a [Katalon Studio](https://www.katalon.com/) project for demonstration purpose. You can clone this
out to your PC and run it with your Katalon Studio.

This project was developed using Katalon Studio 5.7.0.

This project demonstrates how to perform a
primitive *Visual Testing* in Katalon Studio.

# Problem to solve

What do I mean by the word *Visutal Testing*? Any toolset that provides a solution to my requirements as follows, I would regard it a *Visual Testing* solution.

- Often I have to look at the pages of a Web site. Maybe I am a developer, a designer, a tester or just a fan of the site.
- I want to look at as many pages of the site as possible. Coverage matters.
- I want to compare the view of 2 environments; e.g. Production and Development.
- I want to take screen shots of pages as evidence
- I want to find out any difference in view between the two.

If the target Web site has 100 pages, it would take over 60 minutes to go through them. It's too tiring, too boring. I can not continue the job everyday! Therefore I would add the final term:

- I want to automate it somehow.



# Solution

I have made another project titled ['UsingMaterialsInKatalonStudio'](https://github.com/kazurayam/UsingMaterialsInKatalonStudio). This project demonstrates how to take multiple screenshots of web pages and store them into a well-structured file system tree. I named it as **Materials** diretory.
